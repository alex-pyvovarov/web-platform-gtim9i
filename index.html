<p>today on PEI,temperatures dropped to -5 degrees celsius,but with the wind chill,people can expect it to feel like it is -143 degrees celsius. Schools were operating on time, but outdoor recess at elementary schools were being assessed for student safety before sending kids outside.</P>
<p>"We want to make sure that when kids go outside and play,which is important because it gives teachers time off, that they can do so with low risk.We'll make sure that they are bundled up",said elementary school principal,Mrs.Eye M.Scary</P>
<p>information from Environment Canada suggested that this was the most recent temperature trends in the region.</P>

<p>when students were asked if they wanted indoor or outdoor recces,the vote was split</p>
<p>"<b>OUTSIDE</b>"yelled some, which landed them in detention ,so they aren't going outside anyways</p>
<p>"<b>INSIDE</b>"said others more controlled after their friends got those detentions</P>
<p>According to the school boards documentation,"<i>Schools have the right to make decisions about where their students have recess but need to be mindful of these considerations</i>"</p>
